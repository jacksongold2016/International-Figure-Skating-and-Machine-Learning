# International-Figure-Skating-and-Machine-Learning
For a class final project, I aimed to better understand the scoring of major international figure skating competitions from October 2016 through December 2017. Some of these include The International Figure Skating Union (ISU) World Figure Skating Championships 2017 and The ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final 2016. We made use of 4 data frames. While they are explained in greater depth later, in brief, performances give high-level information about the total scores and skaters in each routine; judged_aspects has information about the score breakdown of routines; judge_scores further breaks down each score into the scores that each of the individual judges; and finally, programs give information about the breakdown of all of the competitions and events that we will be analyzing.

By correctly merging (see ERD) we hope to gain insight about the leading factors, jumps, and other components that lead to a winning score at the highest level of the sport.

We hope you not only find out analysis interesting but also learn something new about the rather niche sport of figure skating.
